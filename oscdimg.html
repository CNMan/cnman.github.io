ISO 9660 options: These options cannot be combined with Joliet or UDF options

	-n  Use to allow long file names (longer than DOS 8.3 names)
	-nt Use to allow long file names, but restrict those names for
	    NT 3.51 compatibility
	-d  Use to allow lowercase file names

The length of the file name plus the length of the file name extension shall
not exceed 30 characters for the ISO 9660 file system.  ISO 9660 is the most
widely compatible of the three available file systems produced by CDIMAGE.

NOTE: The (-nt) option cannot be used with the (-d) option

Joliet options: These options cannot be combined with ISO 9660 options

	-j1  This option is used to produce an image that has both the Joliet
	     file system as well as the ISO 9660 file system on it.  The ISO
	     9660 file system will be written with DOS compatible 8.3 file
	     names.  The Joliet file system will have Unicode file names up
	     to 64 characters long.
	-j2  This option is used to produce an image that has only the Joliet
	     file system on it.  Any system not capable of reading Joliet will
	     only see a default text file alerting the user that this image is
	     only available on computers that support Joliet.
	-js  This option overrides the default text file used with the (-j2)
	     option.  Example: -jsc:\readme.txt

Joliet is an extension to the ISO 9660 file system.  It was created to
overcome some of the limitations of that file system.  It allows longer
file names, Unicode characters, and directory depths greater than 8.  Please
note that using the (-j1) option does not duplicate all files on the image.
The (-j1) option simply allows both file systems to view all the data on the
disk.

NOTE: The (-j2) option cannot be used with any UDF options.

UDF options: These options cannot be combined with ISO 9660 options

	-u1  This option is used to produce an image that has both the UDF file
	     system and the ISO 9660 file system.  The ISO 9660 file system
	     will be written with DOS compatible 8.3 file names.  The UDF file
	     system will be written with Unicode file names.
	-u2  This option is used to produce an image that has only the UDF
	     file system on it.  Any system not capable of reading UDF will
	     only see a default text file alerting the user that this image is
	     only available on computers that support UDF.
	-ur  This option overrides the default text file used with the (-u2)
	     option.  Example: -urc:\readme.txt
	-us  This option will create sparse file when available.  This can only
	     be used with the (-u2) option.
	-ue  This option will create embedded files.  This can only be used
	     with the (-u2) option.
	-uf  This option will embed UDF file identifier entries.  This can
	     only be used with the (-u2) option.
	-yl  This option will use long allocation descriptors instead of short
	     allocation descriptors.

Three revisions of the UDF file system supported by CDIMAGE.
The default version is 1.50.
	-udfver102 Writes UDF revision 1.02  (Supported: Windows 98 and later)
	-udfver150 Writes UDF revision 1.50  (Supported: Windows 2K and later)
	-udfver200 Writes UDF revision 2.00  (Supported: Windows XP and later)

NOTE:  See DVD help for information on UDF and DVD Video/Audio images.

Boot options: These options can be used to create bootable CD/DVD images

The following options may only be used for single boot entry images and may
not be combined with any multi-boot entry switches.

	-b  This option is used to specify the file that will be written in the
	    boot sector(s) of the disk.  Example: -bc:\location\cdboot.bin
	-p  This option specifies the value to use for the Platform ID in the
	    El Torito catalog.  The default is 0x00 to represent the x86
	    platform.
	-e  This option means not to use floppy disk emulation in the El Torito
	    catalog.

The following options may be used to generate multi boot entry images and may
not be combined with any single boot entry switches.

Each multi-boot entry is seperated via a # token, as well as the number of
boot entries.  The options for a boot entry are seperated via a comma token.
Each boot option must specify the boot code for that option.

	-bootdata:<num>#defaultbootentry#bootentry2#bootentryN

BootEntryOptions:
	b   This option is used to specify the file that will be written in the
	    boot sector(s) of the disk.  Example: -bc:\location\cdboot.bin
	p   This option specifies the value to use for the Platform ID in the
	    El Torito catalog.  The default is 0x00 to represent the x86
	    platform. 0xEF represents an EFI-based system 
	e   This option means not to use floppy disk emulation in the El Torito
	    catalog.

	t   Specifies the El Torito load segment.  If not specified, defaults to
	    0x7C0

Example:
 -bootdata:2#p0,bc:\location\etfsboot.com#pEF,bc:\location\ESPBootFile
This specifies a multi-boot image with the default image having an x86 boot
sector that launches the ETFSBOOT.com bootcode, and a secondary EFI boot
image that launches ESPBootFile when booted

Optimize options: These options configure optimizations

	-o  This option will encode duplicate files only once.  This uses
	    a MD5 hashing algorithm to compare files.
	-oc This option will encode duplicate files only once.  It does 
	    a binary compare on the files and is slower.
	-oi This option will ignore diamond compression timestamps when 
	    comparing files.

Order options: These options allow specific file layout on disk

	-y5  This option will write all files in an i386 directory first and in
	     reverse sort order.
	-yo  This option specifies a text file that has a layout for the files
	     to be placed in the image.  The rules for this file are listed
	     below.

Rules for order file.

1. The order file shall be in ANSI.
2. The order file shall end in a new line.
3. The order file shall have one file per line.
4. Each file shall be specified relative to the root of the image.
5. Each file shall be specified as a long file name.  No short names are
   allowed.
6. Each file path cannot be longer than MAX_PATH, including volume name.

For example: 

If d:\cdimage looked as follows:
d:\cdimage\1\1.txt
d:\cdimage\2\2.txt
d:\cdimage\3\3.txt
d:\cdimage\3\3_5.txt
d:\cdimage\This is a long name.txt

And you ran the following: cdimage -yod:\orderfile.txt d:\cdimage image.iso

Then d:\orderfile.txt might look like this:

This is a long name.txt
1\1.txt
3\3_5.txt
2\2.txt
3\3.txt

Note that not all files must be listed in the order file.  
Any files that are not listed in this file shall be ordered as they would if 
there was no ordering file.

NOTE: The (-yo) option will take precedence over the (-y5) option.  Also, see
      the DVD help for ordering information on DVD Video/Audio disks.

DVD options: These options allow for DVD Video/Audio disk creation

	-uv  This option specifies that UDF Video Zone compatibility is to
	     be enforced.  This means UDF 1.02 and ISO 9660 are written to
	     the disk.  Also, all files in the VIDEO_TS, AUDIO_TS, and 
	     JACKET_P directories will be written first.  These directories
	     take precedence over all other ordering rules used for this image.
	-ut  This option is used to truncate the ISO 9660 portion of the image.
	     When this option is used, only the VIDEO_TS, AUDIO_TS, and 
	     JACKET_P directories will be visible from the ISO 9660 file
	     system.

NOTE: These options cannot be combined with ISO, Joliet, or UDF options
NOTE: UDF file and directory names in VIDEO_TS, AUDIO_TS, and JACKET_P
      will use 8-bit characters as specified by the DVD Video spec.

	    or depths
	-w2 This option reports all non-DOS compliant file names.
	-w3 This option reports all zero-length files.
	-w4 This option reports each file name copied to the image.
	-yd This option suppresses warnings for non-identical files with the
	    same initial 64K.
	-a  This option displays the allocation summary for files and
	    directories.
	-os This option will show duplicate files when creating the image.

General Options: These are general options on image creation

	-l  This options specifies the volume label.  This should be 32
	    characters or less.  There is no space after this option.
	    Example: -lMyVolume
	-t  This option specifies a time stamp for all files and directories
	    on the image.  Example: -t12/31/2000,15:01:00
	-g  This option  makes all times encoded in GMT time rather than the
	    local time.
	-h  This option will include all hidden files and directories under the
	    source path for this image.
	-c  This option will use ANSI file names instead of OEM file names.
	-y6 This options allows directory records to be exactly aligned at the
	    end of sectors.
	-yw This option opens source files with write sharing.
	-k  This option creates an image even if it fails to open some of the
	    source files.
	-q  This option just scans the source files only; it does not create
	    an image.
	-m  This option is used to ignore the maximum size limit or an image.
	-maxsize This option overrides the default maximum size of an image.
	         The default value is a 74 minute CD unless UDF is used, in
	         which case the default is no maximum size.  The value
	         specified here is represented in MB.
	         Example: -maxsize:4096 limits the image to 4096MB.
	-r  This option resolves symbolic links to their target location.

NOTE: Option (-m) cannot be used with option (-maxsize).</pre><pre>
